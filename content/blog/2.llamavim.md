## Powering productivity with Neovim/NvChad

Neovim has become my go-to editor for development, and with NvChad as the foundation, I've crafted a setup that's both powerful and beautiful. In this post, I'll walk you through the key aspects of my configuration, highlighting the plugins, themes, and customizations that make my workflow efficient and enjoyable.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this configuration, first install NvChad:

```bash [terminal]
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
```

Then, clone my custom config on top:

```bash [terminal]
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-nvim-config ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom
```

Run `:Lazy sync` to install all plugins.

## The Foundation: NvChad

NvChad provides an excellent starting point with its modular plugin system and sensible defaults. My config builds on this by adding specialized plugins for AI assistance, advanced completion, and more.

### Core Structure

The configuration is organized in the `lua/` directory with plugins grouped by category:

```text
lua/
├── core/
│   ├── statusline/
│   ├── tabufline/
│   └── utils.lua
├── plugins/
│   ├── ai/
│   ├── completion/
│   ├── navigation/
│   └── ...
└── themes/
    └── samtone.lua
```

## Most Powerful Plugins

Here are some of the most impactful plugins in my setup:

1. **Supermaven** - AI-powered code completion
2. **Blink.cmp** - Fast completion engine
3. **Telescope** - Fuzzy finder for files, buffers, and more
4. **Neo-tree** - File explorer
5. **Gitsigns** - Git integration
6. **Treesitter** - Syntax highlighting and parsing

## AI-Powered Code Completion

One of the standout features is the AI integration for intelligent code suggestions. I use Supermaven for inline completions that feel natural and context-aware.

::code-group
```lua [supermaven.lua]
---@type NvPluginSpec
-- NOTE: AI Autocomplete
return {
  "supermaven-inc/supermaven-nvim",
  event = {
    "BufReadPost",
    "BufNewFile",
  },
  opts = {
    disable_keymaps = false,
    disable_inline_completion = false,
    keymaps = {
      accept_suggestion = "<C-Tab>",
      clear_suggestion = "<Nop>",
      accept_word = "<A-w>",
    },
  },
}
```

```lua [neocodeium.lua]
---@type NvPluginSpec
-- NOTE: Alternative AI completion
return {
  "monkoose/neocodeium",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  enabled = false,
  opts = {
    filetypes = {
      TelescopePrompt = false,
      ["dap-repl"] = false,
    },
  },
  init = function()
    vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-f>", function()
      require("neocodeium").accept()
    end)
  end,
}
```
::

The `<C-Tab>` key accepts full suggestions, while `<A-w>` accepts just the next word. This makes coding feel like having a pair programmer constantly suggesting improvements.

## Modern Completion Engine

For traditional completion, I use Blink.cmp, which provides fast and fuzzy-matched suggestions from multiple sources.

::code-group
```lua [blink-cmp.lua]
---@type NvPluginSpec
-- NOTE: Completion Engine

return {
  {
    "saghen/blink.cmp",
    enabled = true,
    opts = {
      sources = {
        default = { "ecolog", "lazydev", "lsp", "path", "snippets", "buffer", "avante" },
      },
      completion = {
        list = {
          selection = {
            preselect = false,
            auto_insert = true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

```lua [nvim-cmp.lua]
---@type NvPluginSpec
-- NOTE: Alternative completion engine
return {
  "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
  enabled = false,
  event = "InsertEnter",
  dependencies = {
    "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer",
    "hrsh7th/cmp-path",
    "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp",
    "saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip",
  },
  opts = function()
    return require "nvchad.configs.cmp"
  end,
}
```
::

This setup combines LSP suggestions, snippets, and buffer completions for comprehensive code assistance.

## Beautiful Theming

The `samtone` theme provides a dark, purple-tinted color scheme that's easy on the eyes during long coding sessions.

::code-group
```lua [samtone.lua]
M.base_30 = {
  white = "#d4b8dc",
  black = "#0f0d13",
  darker_black = "#0f0d13",
  one_bg = "#16131b",
  one_bg2 = "#1c1822",
  one_bg3 = "#221c2c",
  grey = "#50406b",
  grey_fg = "#50406b",
  grey_fg2 = "#858392",
  light_grey = "#BFBCC8",
  red = "#f27ec4",
  baby_pink = "#FF84FF",
  pink = "#f27ec4",
  line = "#221c2c",
  green = "#00b875",
  vibrant_green = "#00FFB2",
  nord_blue = "#8B75FF",
  blue = "#7272FF",
  seablue = "#00A4FF",
  yellow = "#f2f27e",
  sun = "#f2987e",
  purple = "#b37ef2",
  dark_purple = "#50406b",
  teal = "#0ADCD9",
  orange = "#f2987e",
  cyan = "#5CDFEA",
  statusline_bg = "#16131b",
  lightbg = "#1c1822",
  pmenu_bg = "#221c2c",
  folder_bg = "#C259FF",
}
```

```lua [highlights.lua]
-- NOTE: NvChad Related Highlights
local M = {}

---@type Base46HLGroupsList
M.override = {
  Comment = {
    italic = true,
  },
  ["@comment"] = { italic = true },
  Search = { fg = "black", bg = "blue" },
  IncSearch = { fg = "black", bg = "red" },
  CurSearch = { fg = "black", bg = "blue" },
  Substitute = { fg = "black", bg = "green" },
  FoldColumn = { bg = "NONE" },
  LspReferenceRead = { link = "Underlined" },
  LspReferenceText = { link = "Underlined" },
  LspReferenceWrite = { link = "Underlined" },
  TbFill = { link = "Normal", bg = "white" },
  NvimTreeRootFolder = { link = "NvimTreeFolderName", fg = "sun" },
  NvimTreeOpenedFolderName = { fg = "seablue" },
  NvimTreeFolderName = { fg = "cyan" },
  NvimTreeFolderIcon = { fg = "yellow" },
  NvimTreeWinSeparator = { fg = "statusline_bg" },
  NvDashAscii = {bg = "one_bg2", fg = "sun" },
  NvDashButtons = { fg = "red" },
  NvDashFooter = {bg ="one_bg2"},
}
```

## Project Management and Navigation

For efficient project navigation, I have Telescope and Neo-tree configured, along with bufferline for tab management.

::code-group
```lua [bufferline.lua]
return {
  "akinsho/bufferline.nvim",
  enabled = true,
  event = "BufReadPre",
  dependencies = "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
  config = function()
    vim.opt.termguicolors = true
    require("bufferline").setup {
      options = {
        hover = {
          enabled = true,
          delay = 200,
          reveal = { "close" },
        },
        diagnostics = "nvim_lsp",
        modified_icon = "●",
        show_close_icon = false,
        show_buffer_close_icons = true,
      },
    }
  end,
}
```

```lua [telescope.lua]
---@type NvPluginSpec
return {
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  cmd = "Telescope",
  init = function()
    require("core.utils").load_mappings "telescope"
  end,
  opts = function()
    return require "nvchad.configs.telescope"
  end,
  config = function(_, opts)
    dofile(vim.g.base46_cache .. "telescope")
    local telescope = require "telescope"
    telescope.setup(opts)

    -- load extensions
    for _, ext in ipairs(opts.extensions_list) do
      telescope.load_extension(ext)
    end
  end,
}
```
