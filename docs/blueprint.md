# **App Name**: Code Terminal Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Interactive CLI Navigation: Simulate a command-line interface allowing users to navigate through different sections of the portfolio by typing commands, like 'projects', 'skills', 'about'.
- Animated Typing Display: Animate the text display in a terminal-style to simulate typing for project descriptions, skill details, and the 'about me' section, enhancing the user experience with a nostalgic and engaging feel.
- Skill Showcase: A dedicated section displaying the developer's skills in web development, Golang, and Clang. Each skill is accompanied by a proficiency level indicator (e.g., a progress bar) and a list of relevant projects.
- "About Me" Section: An "About Me" section providing a brief overview of the developer, their background, and their career goals, personalized with creative and terminal-style formatting.
- Command Auto-Completion: The app suggests and auto-completes terminal commands like 'projects', 'skills', etc., to improve the user's interactive experience. A tool uses contextual awareness and reasoning to determine relevant suggestions, such as adapting command suggestions based on navigation history or user activity, enhancing the ease and efficiency of portfolio navigation.

- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets and terminal text.
- Consider rendering an 'underscore' character that "blinks" at the end of lines, simulating the appearance of a cursor
- Minimalist vector icons in glowing green to represent different sections (projects, skills, etc.).
